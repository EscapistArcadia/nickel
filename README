# Overview

Nickel is designed to be an operating system kernel runnable on modern popular 64-bit architectures, including `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `riscv64`, etc.

As a student interested in computer systems, this kernel aims to help me understand and familiarize myself with more up-to-date concepts and technologies than what I learned from the computer system courses in my undergraduate life. In these courses, I initiated a single-processor multiprocessing kernel with a Round-Robin scheduling algorithm. I also completed several Linux kernel modules on concepts such as major/minor page faults and kernel control flow integrity. But most concepts mentioned in these courses are outdated.

Also, I'm interested in research regarding computer systems (subfields: operating systems, computer architectures, and software-hardware codesign). When I write this README, I believe Nickel could be a foundation for some research topics.

# Keep Track of Progress

To record the progress of development, I maintain a [Notion page](https://escapist.notion.site/nickel) to track the progress and take some note.
